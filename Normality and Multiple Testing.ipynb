Values close to 1 indicate that the distribution is similar to a normal distribution. The smaller the W statistic becomes, the more divergence there is between the distribution of the data and the normal distribution.\n","\n","Tests are very sensitive to sample size.\n","\n","These tests should be accompanied by visualizations since the test will detect very small instances of non normality, especially in large sample sizes. \n","\n","#Multiple Testing Correction: Tukey's Honest Sig DIfference (HSD)\n","\n","This could be used instead of running multiple paired t-tests.\n","\n","HSD performs pairwise tests that use a variability estimate that bases its variability form all groups rather than only from the two groups being tested (F-test).\n","\n","When calculating the probability of getting this ratio, the test statistic, Q will be evaluated in light of a modified probability distribution that takes into account the number of means being tested across all pairwise tests.\n","\n","Running Tukey's HSD using Python's statsmodels package will get us a table with the differences between each pair of means, the upper and lower bounds of that difference estimate, and whether we should reject the null hypothesis that each pair of groups is not different."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XLkHLpjXC3Tu","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":51},"outputId":"e2ea2de6-3ead-456f-bc3f-2a540c0f6cf0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1585833134632,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":571,"user":{"displayName":"Grace Delate","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgitMUsTPJQfKuxnuoSpHSQNrw0nT6sesFAPAOm5Q=s64","userId":"07024464494321232631"}}},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import scipy.stats as stats\n","from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/statsmodels/tools/_testing.py:19: FutureWarning: pandas.util.testing is deprecated.
